Dictators Come from Catholic Nations
Otis Gatewood
All the dictators, with the exception of two from pagan nations (China and Egypt), have arisen from nations dominated by Catholicism.
It was Italy, the nation that mothers Catholicism, that produced Mus- solini. Hitler came to power in Catholic dominated Bavaria and Bayern (Munich and Baveria). Spain produced Franco; Argentina gave birth to Peron; and now Cuba presents the world with Batista and Castro. The dictators of South America come from nations predominated by Cathol- icism. What of Yugoslavia and Russia with Tito, Stalin, and Khrushchev? Both nations are dominated by either Roman or Greek Catholicism! The
same is true of the Satellite nations with their puppet dictators.
Just why is this true? Catholicism teaches obedience to the hierarchy without questions. Catholics are told to obey and not question. Personal study of the Bible is not encouraged-the priests will do their studying
for them-too many questions are dangerous.
This prepares fertile soil for dictators. They also demand obedience
without question. They learned it from the Catholics.
Thus, the records show that Catholicism is a forerunner of dictators.
Beware America!
