Holiday Suggestions
Why not send a gift that lasts the year through? Send the GOSPEL ADVOCATE to a relative, friend, prospect, or public library. It is really fifty-two gifts in one. It may be instrumental in saving a soul.
Why not send a good book? "A book may be a greater thing than a battle," someone has said. Certainly so when it is a Bible or good religious book.
Why not enroll some young preacher in the GA BOOK CLUB? Help him build a much-needed religious library. Carpenters need tools; preach- ers need books. Paul had books and wanted them with him in his last imprisonment.

five years.
The lessons for the first two quarters of 1961 are from John and the
book of Judges.

of our Uniform Bible Lessons, the first quarter free.)
